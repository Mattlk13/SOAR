For upload:
- Update README.md
- Transition to object: dbugOptGrad, dbugOptRest, plotSavingStatus
- Avoid excessive memory usage plotting everything every time, but without saving plots every time!
- External configuration file…
- Re-discuss transition for ‘restDbugMode’ in ITman.restRnds(), implement a better method

Already up:
- @compWith: change the layout for compatibilization with plotSol
- @plotSol: include a plot for visualization of pi
- Introduce the acceleration limitation
- Enter the parallel computing!
- plotTraj does not compare two trajectories
- plotSol does not plot a detailed section
